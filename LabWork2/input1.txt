Hi, Anton!

It's been a while since we have been in touch. How has your semester been?

I wanted to send an email update to you let you know how things have been going during my semester abroad here in MÃ¡laga, Spain. I've already been here for six weeks, and I feel like I am finally adapting to the culture. I'm also speaking the language more fluently.
